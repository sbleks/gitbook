### Jotform Sharing Instructions <a href="#_kmcfl4vbcuqr" id="_kmcfl4vbcuqr"></a>

These instructions are for sharing Jotform data with Hillel Jotform users who are not administrators.

### For Jotform Admins: Share Jotform Data with another Jotform User <a href="#_it2n83mcgvml" id="_it2n83mcgvml"></a>

SSO is required for our account so in addition to sharing a form with a user in the Jotform interface, they need to be given the Jotform app in Okta.

1. Sign in to [hillel.jotform.com](https://hillel.jotform.com/).
2. [View the Form Submissions](https://www.jotform.com/help/269-how-to-view-form-submissions/).
3.  Click the **Share** button.

In order to access your data, you must set up an account on Hillel’s dedicated Jotform server at **hillel.jotform.com.** You might already have an account on **www.jotform.com.** If so, at the end of this process, you will end up with two Jotform items saved in 1Password — one for each server.

* Once invited to see your data, you will receive an email with a link to access the Jotform submissions.
* Click the link in the email, and the Jotform login screen will open in your browser.
* If you **DO** have an existing account at [**www.jotform.com**](about:blank)**:**
  * Click **Forgot Password?** and follow the steps to reset your password.NOTE: This will not reset your password for **www.jotform.com**, but will set a new password on **hillel.jotform.com.** Be sure to save this new password as a new item in 1Password with the URL **hillel.jotform.com.**
* If you do NOT already have an account at [**www.jotform.com**](http://www.jotform.com/)**:**
  * Click **Sign Up** at the bottom of the screen, and follow the prompts to create an account.
* Once signed in, you will be taken to the submissions page that will allow you to see live submissions and download them.
* For accessing your data in the future, go to [hillel.jotform.com/mytables/](https://hillel.jotform.com/mytables/) **and** click **Shared with me.**
